# mapreduce-common-friends
```C
In large-scale social networks, there are normally tens of millions of users. The task of this
assignment is to implement a MapReduce program to identify common friends among all pairs
of users. Let U be a set of all users: {U1, U2, ..., Un}. Then the goal is to find common friends
for every pair of (Ui, Uj) where i â‰  j
The input files have the following format:
A B C D E
B A C D
C A B
D A B E
E A D
where the first token in the line is the user and the remaining tokens in the line are the friends.
So, for line 1, A has four friends, B, C, D, and E. For example, A, and B have C, and D as their
common friends. Also, A and E have only D as their common friend.
